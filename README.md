# Overview

This python package implements a Skip List, which was first concieved of by William Pugh in 1989. A skip list is a probabilistic data structure which maintains a sorted list 
- brief explanation of what it does
- what operations does it support, and what O(time)
- how it works, talk it through
- proof of complexity

# Implementation ?
- talk about child domain, key domain, stablity



Inspired by:

Pugh, William. Skip lists: a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees. In: Communications of the ACM, June 1990, 33(6)668-676.
